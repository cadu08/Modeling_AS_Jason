As in prospecting for gold, a scientist may dig with skill, courage, energy and intelligence just a few feet away from a rich vein - but always unsuccessfully. Consequently in scientific research the rewards for industry, perseverance, imagination and intelligence are highly uncertain [^1].

### Argument in formal language

```javascript
defeasible_rule(correct(P,C2),[similar(C1,C2),correct(P,C1)])[as(argument_from_analogy_v1)].
```

### Argument in natural language

```html
The proposition <P> is true/false to <C1>. Itâ€™s known that <C1> and <C2> are similar. 
Therefore, for analogy, the proposition <P> is also true/false to <C2>.
```

### Argument in formal language

```javascript
defeasible_rule(correct(P,C2),[similar(C1,C2),correct(P,C1),similarity(S)])[as(argument_from_analogy_v2)].
```

### Argument in natural language

```html
There are/is <S> as a similarity between <C1> and <C2>. 
This similarity is relevant to conclude that if the sentence <P> is true for <C1>, 
probably this sentence will be true for <C2> too.
