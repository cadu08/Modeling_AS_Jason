## Argument From Analogy Based on Classification

```
The analogue has features a, b, and c.
The primary subject has features a, b, and c.
It is by virtue of features a, b, and c that the analogue is properly classified as W.
So, the primary subject ought to be classified as W.
```

This scheme shows how argument from analogy is based on classification and, in many typical instances of the kind we have examined, is combined with argument from
classification. They are related by the fact that they are based on a classification of the elements proceeding from properties pointed out in their description. 
[Argument from classification](https://github.com/cadu08/Modeling_AS_Jason/blob/main/AS/ASfromC.md) leads to the conclusion that a particular case or thing has a determinate property because it may be classified as generally having that
property. On the other hand, argument from analogy proceeds from the similarity of two facts under a particular point of view to their categorization under the same
class. Thus there are many close connections between argument from analogy and argument from classification.[^1]

### Argument in formal language

```javascript
defeasible_rule(classified(A2,W),[features(A1,A,B,C),features(A2,A,B,C),classified(A1,W)])[as(from_analog_based_classification)].
```

### Argument in natural language

```html
<A1> has the features: <A>, <B>, and <C>. 
<A2> has also the same features.
<A1> is properly classified as <W>. 
So, <A2> ought to be classified as <W> too.
```
