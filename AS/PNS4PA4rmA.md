The practical counterpart to the scheme for argument from analogy is practical reasoning from analogy. 
The similarity of two situations in some respects is considered a reason to act in a similar way.

## Positive Scheme for Practical Argument from Analogy

<table>
  <tr>
    <td height="40">Major Premise</td>
    <td height="40">The right thing to do in S1 was to carry out A.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td height="40">Minor Premise</td>
    <td height="40">S2 is similar to S1.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td height="40">Conclusion</td>
     <td height="40">Therefore, the right thing to do in S2 is carry out A.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Argument in formal language

```javascript
defeasible_rule(act_classification(CLASSIFICATION,ACTION,CASE2),[similar(CASE1,CASE2), act_classification(CLASSIFICATION,ACTION,CASE1)])[as(PNS4PA4rmA)].
```

### Argument in natural language

```html
The <CLASSIFICATION> thing to do in <CASE1> case was to <ACTION>. 
<CASE2> case is similar to <CASE1> case. 
Therefore, the <CLASSIFICATION> thing to do in <CASE2> case is to <ACTION>.
```

### Example adapted from Walton's book
```
The wrong thing to do in terrorists case was to help. 
Rebels case is similar to terrorists case. 
Therefore, the wrong thing to do in rebels case is to help.
```
